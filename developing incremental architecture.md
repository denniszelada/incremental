The warehouse shouldn't know about the store

Everyon should be an architect, to know how to make things simpler not complex.

on an agile environment an architect role should be more about coordination and education role.

The people in the warehouse has it's same language and people in the store has his own language.

The bounded context see as outside could be a castle

Ask for help, not for information. in the context of the bounded context, in the example of a warehouse you don't go pick a book and ship it, you ask the warehouse to send the book.

Think about isolation as asking for help not for information.

This is not a MVC, an MVC works only to shuffle things to one side to another.

The control job is representation, in modern website the controler is the browser.

Story is a narrative that describes a user performing a domain process that results in a valuable outcome for that user.

Stories describe your user's work not yours.

Examples:

Logging in is not an user story it's just a task, because this doesn't provide value to the user.

Selecting an option neither is a story.

Updating my timesheet is a story.

User stories are not features.
